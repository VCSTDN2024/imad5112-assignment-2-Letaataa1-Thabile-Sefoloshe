Project Overview

Quizly is a mobile application I developed as part of my IMAD5112 subject assignment. This application was created using Kotlin and Android Studio. The app's pivotal purpose is to provide the users with a fun interactive environment to enhance and challenge their knowledge on history.

The design of the Quizly app was based on the following key considerations:


1. Responsiveness: The application is built on multiple screens to ensure it performs exceptionally allowing users to receive the full depth of the application.

2. Simplicity: The design aspect of the application is diverting and fundamental, centring the key features within the application to the user.

Challenges and Learnings

During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges, including:

1.Challenge 1: The project I have submitted is my second quiz app. I faced several issues with my first application. The application battled to push onto the second assignment repository, instead the app would push onto the first assignment repository. Despite countless attempts to rectify the error I was unsuccessful.

2.Challenge 2: The second challenge I faced with my first application was the transitioning between multiple screens. Once the application was up and running whenever I would attempt to switch from one screen to the next, the application would crash. The error message that was generated once I ran the debugging was that "the activity of the second screen should be exported or contain an intent-filter". Several solutions were implemented without success to fix the issue.

Solution: The solution I implemented for both challenges I encountered was to begin a new second application from scratch. Despite the other solutions I tried my outmost to implement I was unsuccessful. Leaving me with no other option due to the constrain of time but to begin a new project.

Future Enhancements

While the current version of the application provides core functionality, there are however few features I will implement to enhance the app, including:

1. Addition of a SeekBar: This will be a innovative feature I instil in the application to display the score. The SeekBar will enhance the experience of the user's utilising the app as it will elevate the entertaining aspect of the application,
2. Timeframe to complete quiz: This feature will challenge the users of the application allowing it to be more engaging and insightful.
